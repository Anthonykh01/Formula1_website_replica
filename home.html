          <h1><img src="william_logo.png" alt="text_logo" class="text_logo" style="max-width: 25px;max-height: 25px;"/>Jack Aitken to drive for Williams in Abu Dhabi FP1 – four months after horror Spa crash</h1>
          <p>Williams reserve driver Jack Aitken will return to the Williams cockpit in Abu Dhabi – almost a year after his Grand Prix debut at Sakhir – just over four months after his sports car crash at Spa-Francorchamps, which left him hospitalised.

            The 26-year-old Briton crashed a Lamborghini GT3 in a multi-car shunt in this year's Spa 24 Hours, suffering vertebra and collarbone fractures. Now he'll return to an F1 cockpit for FP1 in the 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix that ends the season.
            
            Aitken made his practice debut for Williams in the 2020 Styrian GP and was drafted into the race seat for last December's 2020 Sakhir GP – when Lewis Hamilton contracted Covid-19 – for his Grand Prix debut, where he finished 16th.
            
            He will take the wheel of the FW43B once again, this December, as he confirmed this morning.</p>

        <p>Sebastian Vettel’s climb through the field to score points in Austin was due to the tough conditions playing into Aston Martin’s hands, but also featured a fight against one of his favourite rivals…

          Aston Martin took a new power unit on Vettel's car for the race at Circuit of the Americas, ensuring he knew he would start at the back of the grid. Another driver doing the same was George Russell, and as the pair attempted to fight back into the points, Vettel went round the outside of the Williams at the high-speed Turn 16-18 complex.
          
          Top 10 Onboard Moments: 2021 United States Grand Prix
          
          “I like racing George – it’s not the first time this year – because he seems to be aware of where his car is,” Vettel said. “He’s always fair. Obviously sometimes he had the upper hand; this time I had the upper hand, so that was good fun, I enjoyed that.”
          
          Vettel’s move came as he made a two-stop strategy work by running the medium tyre for the first two stints, something he believes was more productive because others struggled with tyre wear more than Aston Martin.</p>

      <h1><img src="redbull_logo.png"  class="text_logo" style="max-width: 25px;max-height: 25px;"/>PALMER: Why Verstappen’s Austin win was such a seminal race for Red Bull's title contender</h1>
      <p>The US Grand Prix weekend was a display of near perfection from both of the championship protagonists throughout qualifying and the race, but with Red Bull managing to unlock a little more pace in Austin, it was Max Verstappen who edged out Lewis Hamilton to take a crucial victory.

        Verstappen has been mightily impressive for a few seasons now, but unlike before, this season he has had to deal with the monumental pressure of a championship challenge, and not just any title fight, one against a driver as successful as Lewis Hamilton and a team as proven as Mercedes.</p>

    <p>"A great duel between two brilliant drivers at the top of their game"; Sky F1's Martin Brundle analyses a United States GP battle that could swing Max Verstappen-Lewis Hamilton title fight plus the other big stories from Austin as F1 enjoys epic USA return
      I have no doubt that Sunday's USA GP will be considered a significant pivot point when eventually looking back at this year's outstanding world championship.

    A great duel between two brilliant drivers at the top of their game, it was effectively a 14-point swing for whoever won between Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen
    The Circuit of The Americas was bursting at the seams with 140,000 enthusiastic fans on race day who were at the circuit very early in a way reminiscent of the likes of Silverstone and Spa, and clearly passionate about Formula One in a way I've personally never seen before in the USA. One fan told me at the airport that by Saturday Red Bull merchandise was sold out, and everything else was feverishly being bought up.

    And what a cliffhanger of a race it turned out to be, the only thing missing was some wheel-to-wheel action in the last couple of laps

  <p>Red Bull thinks it would have been "brutal" for Sergio Perez to sacrifice a podium at Formula 1's United States Grand Prix just to deny Lewis Hamilton fastest lap point
    Perez was running third in the closing stages at Austin, with second-placed Hamilton on course to grab the extra championship point that comes from taking the fastest lap.

  With the title battle between Verstappen and Hamilton so tightly poised, one of the features of this season has been of Mercedes and Red Bull trying to deny their rival the extra fastest lap by using their second drivers.

  Most famously at the British Grand Prix, Perez had been running in 10th place and looked on course to move up the order when Red Bull ordered him to give up a points scoring finish to take fastest lap from Hamilton.

  At Austin on Sunday, Perez was not in a position to have a free pitstop, with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc within range in the closing stages, so a late call for fresh tyres would have dropped him out of the top three.

  And, on a day when Perez had battled against illness and dehydration caused by a broken drinks system, Red Bull agrees it would have been too much to ask him to give up the podium simply to hurt Hamilton.

    "It would have been brutal to pit Checo and take him off the podium," said Horner when asked by Motorsport.com about why they opted against going for the fastest lap.

"Leclerc was obviously too close behind. In the collective position of the team it was better for Checo to take the points. So that's what we did."
